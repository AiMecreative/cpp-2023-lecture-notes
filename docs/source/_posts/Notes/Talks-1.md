# Talks. 10.29

---

- code with me
- programming task 1
- programming task 2
- other problems
- debug
- what should I do

---

### code with me

----

- rewrite the quadratic equation
- draw an image using cpp
- but with given data...

----

- learn the STANDARD(maybe?) coding
- how to use a function
- how to do file io
- how to name variables
- how to format your code
- how to ...

---

### programming task 1

----

#### question 0

- define `int` or `double`
- if use acceleration ...

----

#### question 1

- when to calculate delta
- how many branches needed
- handle complex number
  - how to print
- now refactor the code

----

#### question 2

- delete the tail zeros

----

#### question 3

- just math

---

### programming task 2

----

#### question 0

- input checking
  - does it matter?
  - other solutions?

----

#### question 1

- how many loops we need
- how to check the middle results

----

#### question 2

- everything is `int` ?
- how to select your test data

----

#### question 3

- what if change the range to `[10, 9435]` or someone else

----

#### question 4

$arctan(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\inf} (-1)^{k}\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}$ for $\forall x \in [-1, 1]$

- focus on your target: calculate $\pi$
- $\pi = 3.14159...$
- why the answer is $0.78...$

---

### other problems

- life circle (simplized version)
- initialize your variables!
- format your code!
- `for` loop is just `for` loop

----

- `=` and `==`, and even `===`(Java)
- why no Chinese in my programs
- standard and simplify your io
- what is the path of file or folder

---

### debug

- just print print print!
- a more complex but useful method: debugger
- variable value & function stack

---

### what should I do

- one cpp source file -> one project -> one question
- submit your **source code file only** (xxx.cpp)
- name a source file with **no Space,tab,(,),Chinese...**
- name a folder with **just your name**
- run code **before** submit
  - use more test demos

---- 

- CS learning routine: [csdiy](https://csdiy.wiki/)
- searching is also an ability
  - use [official docs](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
  - English reading
  - just copy your error the IDE gives and paste it on the right brower

----

- what makes me angry
  - [no screenshot!!!](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/552422979)
  - no code or no output (results or errors) and just say "what happened"
    - who knows
  - no self-searching, even a little problem
    - I also have my silly things...
